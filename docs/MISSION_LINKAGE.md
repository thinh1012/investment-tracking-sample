# 🔗 Mission Linkage: Connecting Thoughts to Code

This document tracks the conceptual evolution of Alpha Vault Pro. It links the user's "Vibes" and high-level ideas to actual project milestones, preventing thought-clutter and keeping the path clear.

## 📍 Active Mission: Sync Stability & Visibility
- **Status**: 🚀 In Progress (Dec 2025)
- **Objective**: Implement a 15-minute auto-sync window and a "Last Sync" status indicator on the dashboard.
- **Requester**: Product Manager

## 🧠 The "Vibe" Vault
*Capturing thoughts that go everywhere to ensure they land somewhere.*

| Vibe / Thought | Execution Status | Linked Code / Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Premium Aesthetics"** | Continuous | `index.css`, Glassmorphism styles |
| **"No development for UI now"** | Respected | Focusing on Logic & Architecture |
| **"Efficient Modularization"** | **Active** | `src/services/database/`, `market-picks/` |
| **"Security First"** | Core Rule | `PROJECT_RULES.md`, Cloud Sync Encryption |
| **"Sync Visibility (PM)"** | ✅ Done | Sync Status UI & 15-min Rule |
| **"Agent Interaction Workflow"** | ✅ Codified | `PROJECT_RULES.md` protocol finalized |
| **"Data Leakage Audit"** | **Active** | `[SECURITY_OFFICER]` Deployment Checks |
| **"Mobile Input Sync"** | Refined | `CloudSyncModal.tsx`, Supabase integration |

## 🚀 Roadmap Linkages
Future thoughts to be integrated as they mature:
1.  **[ ] Dynamic LP Delta Tracking**: Advanced range-bound PnL.
2.  **[/] Zero-Knowledge Cross-Device Sync**: Focus on phone-to-cloud bridge (Supabase).
3.  **[/] Deployment Security Gate**: Implementation of [SECURITY_OFFICER] audit for every build/push.
4.  **[ ] Sentinel Alert Loop**: Proactive RSI/Price breach triggers.
